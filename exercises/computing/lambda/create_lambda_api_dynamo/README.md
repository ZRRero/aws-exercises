## Computing AWS - Create a Lambda function with proxy API Gateway and DynamoDB database

### Objectives

1. Create a DynamoDB table with the following characteristics
    1. Throughput should be the dominant cost
    2. Table should be on demand
    3. Encryption is managed by AWS
   4. Partition key is a string
   5. No sort key
2. Create a Lambda function with the following characteristics

    2. Should be versioned and have an Alias called "Current" pointing to latest version
    3. Receive two possible operations in path:
       1. First operation is POST /events/ which should store in Dynamo the body and an extra attribute pointing at the version
       2. Second operation is GET /events/{event_id} which should get from Dynamo the opbject, or a 404 if the item does not exist
    4. Code must be stored in S3
    5. Timeout of 1 second
3. Create an HTTP Api Gateway with the following characteristics
   1. A stage called production
   2. For a proxy route in /events/{+proxy} pointing to Lambda in a Lambda proxy integration
